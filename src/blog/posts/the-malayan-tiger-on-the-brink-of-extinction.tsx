        Why is the Malayan Tiger so important?
      </Typography>
      The Malayan tiger is one of the smallest tiger species. Measuring 250 cm in length on average,
      they are carnivores, surviving off a diet of various types of deer and other animals. Up until
      2004, they were believed to be the same species as the Indochinese tiger, until DNA testing
      revealed them to be an entirely separate subspecies, unique to the Peninsula and the Southern
      tip of Thailand.
      <br /> <br />
      The tiger is an apex predator and its role in the food web is essential. It keeps populations
      in check, maintaining the balance between herbivores and vegetation. It is commonly said that{' '}

      . Their role is an imperative one in the maintenance of a thriving jungle and a healthy
      environment.
      <br /> <br />
      The tiger’s importance in Malaysian culture is key; it has become a national symbol, appearing
      on the coat of arms, in the logo of Malaysian institutions like Proton and Maybank and as a
      nickname for Harimau Malaya, the national football team. The tiger appears often in Malaysian
      folklore and mythology, sometimes as were-tigers, harimau jadian, or other times in stories
      with the mouse-deer. It is a symbol of strength and courage in this country and forms an
      intrinsically unique part of the fabric of Malaysia.
      <br /> <br />
      Already we have lost tiger species; the Javan tiger was last sighted in the 1970&apos;s and
      the Bali tiger in the 1930&apos;s. The former disappeared due to loss of habitat, and the
      latter was hunted to extinction. The Malayan tiger’s importance in both the forest and in
      Malaysian culture means the unique subspecies cannot and should not be next.

      .
      <br /> <br />
      Malaysian jungles used to be connected from the Southern tip of the peninsula all the way up
      to the Thai border. However due to deforestation, what was once a long corridor that allowed
      tigers the liberty to range across the entire length of the country, has become a series of
      islands, shattered and isolated by logging paths, highways, plantations and more. These have
      forced animals into smaller and smaller spaces of land, making it ever more difficult for them
      to survive. The destruction of the forest means a shortage of food and prey as well as loss of
      shelter for tigers. The Sambar Deer, the Malayan Tiger’s primary food source, has also been
      listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2008, with populations declining due
      to hunting, industrial exploitation of the jungle, and loss of the vegetation upon which they
      feed. These islands also push tigers closer to human populations where they are more likely to
      be hunted and killed.

        Poaching for Wildlife Trade

      . They were also sentenced to two years in prison, after having been convicted on 20 charges.
      They possessed leopard, tapir and sun bear parts, animals who are threatened and protected,
      and pleaded guilty to the illegal use of snares. Should they fail to pay the fine, they will
      be jailed for another 16 years. Among their loot were perhaps the parts of two Malayan tigers,
      two clouded leopards, and three sun bears. And whilst this case can be seen as a win for a
      judiciary system that up until recently had remained rather lax on poachers, it must also be
      highlighted that between the two of them, the men managed to set over 190 snares in the
      Terengganu area alone.
      <br /> <br />
      Snares are steel cable nooses, valued by poachers for their simplicity. They are set up along
      tiger paths and left unattended for unsuspecting animals to walk into. These animals are then
      left to a slow and painful death, as the harder you pull the tighter the noose becomes. They
      are doomed to be collected by local or foreign poachers at a later date. Snares aren’t choosy;
      they trap any and all animals from deer to tigers. They have also resulted in amputated paws,
      and three-legged sun bears, tapirs, tigers, and more, handicapped in the jungle. A tiger
      without its claws cannot hunt, leaving it to die again, a slow and painful death.
      <br /> <br />
      But why are people still willing to venture so deep into the jungle despite the risks and
      illegality involved? Tiger parts are some of the most coveted animal parts in the world. Every
      part is in high demand. Their meat is consumed as a delicacy, their skin, skull, claws and
      teeth are traded as trophies, and their bones, blood and sexual organs are desired for their
      mythical medicinal qualities. In fact, in Chinese medicine, practically every part of the
      tiger has some sort of medicinal value, and with the rising affluence of China, the demand for
      everything from tiger fat to tiger penises has risen too. <br /> <br />
      The illegal wildlife trade rakes in anywhere from{' '}

      a year according to a 2016 UN estimate. It’s no wonder that tigers are facing challenges on
      this front, especially given the access foreign poachers have through the northern border.
      Tigers are being hunted and poached ruthlessly and something needs to change in order for this
      to stop.

        What do we need to do?
      </Typography>
      Although the situation may currently seem dire, it’s important not to lose hope. There are
      plenty of people who are passionately committed to saving the Malayan tiger. Two such NGOs are{' '}
      <Link href="https://rimbaresearch.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        Rimba
      </Link>{' '}
      and{' '}
      <Link href="https://www.rimau.ngo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        Rimau
      </Link>
      , organisations made up of both part time volunteers and full time activists, with backgrounds
      ranging from documentary film makers to professors and researchers. NGOs such as these are
      actively working in areas ranging from Belum, in the central part of peninsula Malaysia, to
      Kenyir Lake, in Terengganu state, to send people into the forest to remove snares and track
      poachers. However, they advocate for more boots on the ground; to prevent this precious
      species from dying out, we need rangers with the authority to arrest poachers and deter more
      from entering our forests.
      <br /> <br />
      These organisations are also committed to educating all levels of the population from young
      children all the way through to politicians. There is a desperate need to embed core values
      within our society that teach people to treasure the tiger as a symbol of national heritage,
      to cherish the forests and jungles we are so fortunate to have here in Malaysia, and to
      generally care more for the flora and fauna we share this country with. The education of young
      people aims to instill such values. The education of people in power like judges and
      politicians intends to catalyse more immediate action. It was partly thanks to Rimba’s
      programmes which sought to teach judges about the impact of poachers on tigers that a more
      severe sentencing of the Vietnamese poachers caught earlier this year was possible.
      <br /> <br />
      Tiger numbers are dropping quickly. Action needs to be taken now if we hope to save the
      Malayan tiger from extinction. And there’s plenty that you can do.

        Actions you can take
      </Typography>
      Educate yourself on the state of the forests in Malaysia. Which species live in them, and what
      flora grows? Venture outside and witness for yourself the beauty our spectacles of nature have
      to offer. Go on a hike to see waterfalls in Taman Negara or Gombak, the ocean in Kuantan or
      Terengganu. Whatever your preferences, from caves to highlands, islands to deep jungle, there
      is always somewhere in Malaysia for you to explore. Gain an appreciation for these places —
      they are part of a crumbling national heritage and should be treated as such, in the same way
      Melaka and Penang have conserved their sites. Then, spread the message too! Influence your
      communities, your families, schools, workplaces to educate themselves on the natural wonders
      just outside their doorsteps. Perhaps take them on a walk at FRIM or with the Malaysian Nature
      Society. Maybe try and live in a slightly more environmentally mindful manner, by paying
      attention to what you eat and what you consume daily.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are Malaysian, investigate the stance of your politicians, so you might hold them
      accountable. Last year, a coalition of{' '}

        20 NGOs
      </Link>{' '}
      appealed for politicians to include environmental issues in their political agendas. Call for
      your leaders to take action in protecting the extensive biodiversity we are fortunate enough
      to have in this country. <br />
      <br />
      If you have the means, you may be interested in donating to one of the NGOs listed above, all
      of whom are doing great work in actively trying to get boots on the ground by increasing the
      number of rangers who are able to patrol the jungle, remove snares and catch poachers. In
      particular, check out Rimba, if you want to see what conservationists are doing, and Rimau, if
      you want to get directly involved by volunteering. <br /> <br />
      Even if we make a great, concerted effort, reversing the current trend of tiger decline in
      Malaysia is a battle that will require tremendous luck and persistence. If nothing is done, we
      can expect the extinction of the Malayan tiger in the wild by 2022 and within a couple of
      generations, we will have lost 4 tiger subspecies. The food webs of Malaysian jungles will
      collapse, forests will suffer, and even more animals will be fated to perish. And for our
      children? The only place they will still be able to see the Malayan tiger — symbol of courage,
      strength and freedom — will be behind bars.

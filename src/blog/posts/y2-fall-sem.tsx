    Dear -, <br />
    I apologise profusely for the delay, but here I am writing - finally.
    <br />
    <br />
    We're in the midst of midterm season at the moment here. The weather is grim in a way I don't
    believe October is allowed to be; it's far too cold (but I refuse to be so weak as to wear a
    jacket in <i>October</i>), misty and rainy. The perfect weather to be curled in bed with a cup
    of tea and a good book. Instead I find myself typing this from a seat in the library overlooking
    campus. I switched degrees from physics and computer science to mathematics and computer
    science. Not the most radical change, but I avoided doing labs and circuits and, well, physics
    (Which in hindsight, makes me wonder why I ever applied for the subject in the first place given
    my distaste for it). But maths is fun. The other day, my professor spent 10 minutes proving that
    open intervals are open and closed intervals are closed, which I would've thought was pretty
    self-explanatory, but apparently not. So that was rather cool. I've taken one arts course here:
    <i> Introduction to world religions</i> or something like that, but I didn't find it
    particularly invigorating so I haven't really ventured into taking more electives in other
    areas. I think taking an elective in EngLit might be more interesting, but I'm not sure I'll
    have time to do that in the next year and a half. I am taking history and philosophy of
    mathematics this semester to lighten my course load. It's taught by a very loud, mildly
    problematic, opinionated 70 year old man. It's been nice to have a course that doesn't have me
    staring at equations and formulas completely lost; instead I get to hear T.Fox animate the death
    of Hypatia, the genius of Archimedes and canonise various other mathematicians as members of the
    Church of Mathematics.
    <br />
    <br />
    Montreal and McGill are actually a lot of fun though. I realise I might've painted a grey
    picture thus far, but like I said, it's midterm season and thus very hectic. Apart from the
    hellish cold, which I'm not sure how I managed to survive last year, the city is always vibrant,
    with museums, concerts, night life, and art galleries. I've met some interesting people who've
    caused me to say things like 'fall' instead of 'autumn' and have forced me to reconsider a lot
    of things I took for granted back in KL. I went back this summer - you appreciate the Malaysian
    warmth and cuisine and warmth a lot more once you've been gone for a year.
    <br />
    <br />
    It's kind of wild to think I'm nearly halfway through my degree. It feels like only yesterday I
    was still in secondary, freaking out about EngLit coursework and such. Daphne went back to visit
    the campus and she tells me they're building a fantastic new sixth form centre and library. I
    can't begin to imagine. Anyways, I'm sorry again for taking such a long time to write. I hope
    your return back to Europe has worked out well and I'd love to hear about what you have been up
    to in the last 500 or so days.

    As I am coming to the end of my bachelor‚Äôs in mathematics and computer science, I have begun
    looking for opportunities where I can best apply the skills I have learnt to address today‚Äôs
    pressing environmental and social challenges.
    <br />
    Whilst a lot of awe-inspiring, cutting-edge, all-around-cool work is being done in this space,
    it can sometimes be hard to navigate. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to speak to lots of lovely,
    kind, generous people in the climate tech community who have shared resources and tips. They are
    compiled here for anyone else who might be looking to begin a career in climate work and find
    climate related tech roles.
